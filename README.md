# The project I selected for my portfolio is the clock program from module 3. I chose the first project we completed because I feel it is a great display of the foundational skills learned through this course. For this assignment, we were tasked with developing a program that would display standard 12 hour time and military 24 hour time. We were given a visual flowchart to help guide our coding, which was a great resource and learning experience to grasp how beneficial planning ahead with pseudocode or flowcharts can be for the development of a project. 

# This was a great assignment to hone my overall developing skills as a beginner. I strove to implement best practice be remaining consistent and providing in-line comments where necessary. I also felt I did particularly well following the flowchart as a guide to the companyâ€™s desired outcome. However, I still feel I have so much room for improvement in all areas of coding.
